Typically, the surface layer is brown loam which is about12 inches thick.  The subsoil is reddish brown to yellowish red sandy clay loam which is about 29 inches thick.  Below this layer to a depth of 58 inches is a pink sandy clay loam with about 20 percent visible calcium carbonate.  Below this layer to a depth of 80 inches is a reddish yellow sandy clay loam.   The depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 3 percent. This component is in the R077CY022TX Deep Hardland 16-21"" Pz ecological site.  The natural plant community is dominantly a mixture of blue grama and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairieclover.  Non-irrigated land capability classification is 3e. Irrigated land capability classification is 2e.  The major land uses for these soils is wildlife and some pasture.  The maximum calcium carbonate equivalent within a depth of 40 inches is 50 percent. There are no saline horizons, and there are no sodic horizons within this soil. The average annual temperature for this map unit ranges from 57 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit.  The average annual precipitation for this map unit ranges from 17 to 21 inches.  
Minor components indentified in this map unit are the Estacado, Friona and Amarillo soils.  Estacado soils have carbonates at shallower depths within the profile.  Friona soils have a petrocalcic horizon between 20 and 40 inches from the surface.  Amarillo soils have a lighter surface color with less organic matter as they are not mollisols.  Estacado, Friona and Amarillo soils occur on similar landforms compared to the Acuff soils.

The Berda series was established in Hale County, Texas; l969. The aggregated data for the MLRA map unit for the project was developed using the Floyd County type location (S1999TX153111).  The Berda fine sandy loam, phase map unit is mapped south of the Canadian Breaks in MLRA 77E. The average mean annual soil temperature is slightly higher and the number of frost free days are higher on average than Berda soils mapped further north. The Berda series is a benchmark soil.  Continued documentation in the future will help improve and enhance the range of characteristics, physical and chemical properties, and map unit composition for these soils.

Use and Management: 

Major land uses: These soils are primarily used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.

Cropland: These soils are poorly suited to cropland. The slope, runoff, and moderate available water capacity of the soil are limitations. The hazard of erosion is severe.

Rangeland: These soils are moderately suited to rangeland. Native plants are dominantly short and mid-grasses, which produce moderate amounts of forage. Moderate runoff and available water capacity are limitations. The hazard of erosion is severe. The main concerns in management are continuous overgrazing, fire suppression, invasion of woody species, and low order perennial grasses or annual forbs. Proper stocking rates, brush management, and controlled grazing can help improve or maintain productivity.

Urban Development: These soils are well suited for most urban uses. They are somewhat limited as a site for the construction of local roads and streets or for use as road-fill material. The low soil strength is a minor limitation.

Recreational Development: This soil is well suited to most recreational uses. Dustiness is somewhat limiting. Recreational areas may require water or special surfacing material during dry periods to prevent excessive dustiness due to heavy foot traffic.

Wildlife Habitat: These soils have fair potential for use as wildlife habitat. Wind erosion is a potential hazard for grain and seed crops used for food and cover. The moderately arid conditions, which can limit plant growth necessary for good habitat is a minor limitation.

Evaluation of Map Unit Interpretations

Interpretation Join Issues:
None

Future Project Needs: 
Berda is an MLRA 77E soil and the type location is located in Floyd County, Texas in MLRA-77E.  The Berda fine sandy loam phase map unit is mapped south of the Canadian Breaks on draws and below escarpments in areas considered MLRA-77E.  The elevation is generally lower in southern extent of the series and average mean annual air and soil temperature is slightly higher.  Also the number of average frost free days are higher for Berda soils mapped further north.  Separating the Berda warm and Berda cool into two different series will be evaluated in a future project.   Areas that are mapped Berda in MLRA 78 will need to be correlated to another series in future updates.  The Berda series will need to be evaluated to determine if the type location should remain in Floyd County, Texas.  
Evaluation of the Spatial Data

Mapunit concept notes and issues: 

The Bippus series was established in Deaf Smith County, Texas in 1941. The Bippus OSD is based on the type location in Floyd County Texas. The aggregate data for the MLRA map unit for this map unit was developed using the type location from Floyd County, Texas (077C-P98-TX153-183.). Update mapping is needed among the counties in this SDJR project. Documentation will be gathered at this time.

Use and Managment: 

Major land uses: Bippus soils are used primarily as rangeland and habitat for wildlife. A few small areas are used as improved pasture or cropland.

Cropland: While not extensively used for cropland this soil is well suited. Most areas are so narrow that use as cropland is limited and occasional flooding is a hazard. The most common crops grown on this soil are cotton and grain sorghum. Other crops also include wheat, sunflowers, and forage sorghum. The main concerns in management are conserving soil moisture and controlling soil erosion. Fertilizer applications, reduced tillage, high-residue cover crops, and crop residue management can help reduce the soil temperature, conserve moisture, and improve or maintain soil tilth and productivity. Terraces, contour farming, grassed waterways, and diversion terraces, where needed, can help control runoff and water erosion. Improved varieties of bermudagrass and bluestems are the major pasture grasses grown on these soils. Fertilizer applications, weed control, brush management, proper stocking rates, and controlled grazing can help conserve soil moisture and improve or maintain productivity.

Rangeland: These soils are well suited to rangeland. Native plants yield high amounts of forage. Occasional flooding is a minor limitation. The main concerns in management are continuous overgrazing, fire suppression, invasion of woody species, and low order perennial grasses or annual forbs. Proper stocking rates, brush management, and controlled grazing can help improve or maintain productivity.

Urban Development: These soils are poorly suited to most urban uses. They are very limited as a site for sanitary facilities and building site development. The occasional flooding is a major limitation. Overcoming these limitations is difficult and costly. Pipelines, storage tanks, and other underground structures made of uncoated steel should be protected from the moderate corrosion potential of these soils. This can be overcome by providing cathodic protection or by using galvanized steel.

Recreational Development: These soils are moderately suited to most recreational uses. They are very limited as a site for camp areas unless protected from the hazard of flooding. The season, duration, and frequency of flooding should be considered in planning playgrounds and other recreational areas.

Wildlife Habitat: This soil has good potential for use as wildlife habitat. Occasional flooding is a minor limitation.

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
There are a few differences between the map units and the MLRA map units. 
	The first difference is the MLRA is unspecified including the MLRA unit, the units should be 77E. 
	The Ecosite I.D. and name for Andrews County is (R077DY023TX) The ecosite I.D. and name should be R077EY052TX. 
	The landform for Hansford, Curry County and Southwest Part of Quay County, New Mexico is flood plains on draws, it should be ephermal streams on draws. 
	The surface texture for Cochran County is loam, and it should mirror the MLRA map unit as clay loam. 
	The Horizon name should be A or Ap, and not H1. 
	Cochran County the first mineral structure is weak fine granular structure and should be moderate fine granular structure. The same can be said for Curry County and Southwest Part of Quay County, New Mexico with the first mineral structure. 
	The runoff class is negligible for the MLRA map unit.  The county map units do not have a runoff class assignment.
	The MLRA map unit has a flooding frequency/duration assignment of /occasional and very brief.  The county map units do not have a flooding duration assignment.
	The flooding months are different between the MLRA map unit and the county map units. 
	The K factor for the MLRA map unit is 0.20.  The county map units have different K factors. 
	The MLRA map unit has the non-irrigated capability class and an irrigated capability class of 2w.  The county map units have different capability class assignments.
	The Farmland class should be prime farmland if protected from flooding or not frequently flooded during the growing season.

Evaluation of Map Unit Interpretations

Interpretation Join Issues:
	The Ecosite I.D. and name for Andrews County is (R077DY023TX) The ecosite I.D. and name should be R077EY052TX. 
	The landform for Hansford, Curry County and Southwest Part of Quay County, New Mexico is flood plains on draws, it should be ephermal streams on draws. 
	The surface texture for Cochran County is loam, and it should mirror the MLRA map unit as clay loam. 
	Cochran County the first mineral structure is weak fine granular structure and should be moderate fine granular structure. The same can be said for Curry County and Southwest Part of Quay County, New Mexico with the first mineral structure. 
	The runoff class is negligible for the MLRA map unit.  The county map units do not have a runoff class assignment.
	The MLRA map unit has a flooding frequency/duration assignment of /occasional and very brief.  The county map units do not have a flooding duration assignment.
	The flooding months are different between the MLRA map unit and the county map units. 
	The K factor for the MLRA map unit is 0.20.  The county map units have different K factors. 
	The MLRA map unit has the non-irrigated capability class and an irrigated capability class of 2w.  The county map units have different capability class assignments.
	The Farmland class should be prime farmland if protected from flooding or not frequently flooded during the growing season. 
	Currently most interpretations are almost identical for the old county map unit and the MLRA map unit.
	Differences include interpretation changes on being too dusty, Flooding, water gathering surface, Shrink swell potential, subsidence risk, slow water movement.

Future Project Needs:
More mapping and transecting is needed to gather more information on the MLRA map unit. 

Evaluation of the Spatial Data
Spatial Join Issues:
No spatial join issues.

Spatial Data Quality: 
There are no spatial join issues with any of the map units. The only issue with the map unit is that a portion of the map units lie outside the MLRA area.

None of the pedons except for the typical pedons are linked to the components in NASIS.
The pedons and transects are distributed throughout the SDJR area so there appears to be an adequate amount of documentation.

Other Attribute Issues:
None

Future Project Needs:
More mapping and transecting is needed to gather more information on the MLRA map unit. 

Evaluation of Map Unit Interpretations

Interpretation Join Issues:
There are several differences between the MLRA map unit and the county map units of the project that may cause some interpretation issues:
The Armstrong County ecosite shows (R077EY058TX), Loamy Bottomland 16-24 PZ. It should mirror the MLRA map unit R077EY052TX, Draw 16-24 PZ.
The runoff class for the MLRA map unit is negligible. The county map units do not have a runoff class assignment.
Borden and Dickens Counties have a flooding frequency as rare while the MLRA map unit has a flooding frequency of none. These counties have flooding months as the MLRA map unit has no months entered.
The K factors for the MLRA map unit is 0.20.  The county map units have K factors ranging between 0.24 and 0.32.
The non-irrigated and irrigated capability classes are 2w for the MLRA map unit, however the non-irrigated and irrigated capability classes are 2e for the county map units.
Currently most interpretations are almost identical for the old county map unit and the MLRA map unit.
Differences include interpretation changes on being too dusty, Flooding, Unstable excavation walls, water gathering surface, shrink-swell potential, and slow water movement.

F7g2--Potter soils, 3 to 20 percent slopes

MLRA: 77E-Southern High Plains, Breaks

Geographic Extent:
These map units are correlated in Bailey, Castro, Crosby, Howard, Martin, and Midland Counties in Texas.  The Official Series Type Location is currently located in Lubbock County, Texas (TX065) in MLRA 77E.

Geographic Setting: 
Elevation: 2295 to 5295 feet (701 to 1615 meters)
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 22 inches (406 to 559 millimeters)
Mean annual air temperature: 57 to 63 degrees F (14 to 17 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 185 to 220 days
PZ Index Values: 16 to 24. 

Geomorphic Setting: 
Major Components (s):  
The Potter soils are valley sides on breaks, or draws on plateaus.

Minor Components:  
The Potter component makes up 85 percent of the map unit.  Minor components identified in this map unit are the Veal and Kimberson soils.  Veal soils are on similar landscape positions but have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  The Kimberson soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a petrocalcic horizon.
Parent Material and Geology:
Calcareous, loamy alluvium from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.

Typical Vegetation or Crops:
This map unit is primarily used for range and wildlife habitat.
This component is in the R077EY068TX Very Shallow 16-24"" Pz ecological site. The natural plant community is a mixture of short and midgrasses with a few tall grasses. A moderate amount of forbs and shrubs are also present. Major grass species are sideoats grama, little bluestem, hairy grama, blue grama, slim tridens, and buffalograss. The major forbs include black samson, dotted gayfeather, catclaw sensitivebriar, and annual forbs. Yucca, catclaw acacia, ephedra, skunkbush, and feather dalea are the major woody species.  
Non-irrigated land capability classification is 7s.  These soils are poorly suited to cropland. The low available water holding capacity, high carbonate content, droughtiness, slope, shallow rooting depth, and high rate of runoff are major limitations.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.

Map unit Composition and Reliability:
Potter soils and similar soils: 85 percent
Veal fine sandy loam and similar soils: 8 percent
Kimberson gravelly loam and similar soils: 7 percent

Map unit composition was determined by published manuscripts.  Map unit component percentages were determined by analysis of the published manuscripts, transects and the expert knowledge of the individuals who have worked within the area.

Classification:
Potter classification: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic Petronodic Ustic Haplocalcids  
The Potter series was established in 1929 in Potter County, Texas

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Potter soils, 3 to 20 percent slope map unit are very deep, gently sloping to moderately steep, well drained soils that occur on valley sides on breaks, or draws on plateaus. The parent material consists of calcareous, loamy alluvium from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.

Typically, the surface layer is grayish brown gravelly loam about 15 cm thick and is strongly effervescent.  The subsoil is a light brownish gray very gravelly sandy loam about 38 cm thick that is violently effervescent.  Below this layer is violently effervescent white very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam. 
Coarse fragments range from 35 to 85 percent of the total volume of this soil in the particle-size control section and consist of strongly cemented to indurated calcium carbonate fragments.
Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low. Available water to a depth of 60 inches is low.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content 

in the surface horizon is about 4 percent.  The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 69 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface.
Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
* The Potter soils 3 to 20 percent slope map unit as determined is not mapped over multiple geologies but is mapped over multiple MLRA boundaries.  Potter soils occur in outliers of MLRA 77E that occur as part of MLRA 77C or 77D. 
* The OSD lies in the mid-range to slightly south of the series extent in an outlier of MLRA-77E.  
* The series taxonomic classification was not the same between all counties.
* The ESDs are identical and range productivity was almost identical as well except for the one in Midland County. This will be further evaluated in an update survey.
* The parent material and landforms were basically identical
* The climatic data and elevation differences were insignificant between map units.
* The chemical and physical data varies only slightly between components.  
* The WEI and WEG are not consistent between counties.  
* The data populated in NASIS for the new SDJR Potter map unit is very similar to data populated for the older out-of-date units.  Major interpretations for the map unit will not be affected by this SDJR project.      

The future needs for this and surrounding map units is to refine the mapping of the Potter soils map unit in update mapping projects for Counties in MLRA 77. 

The Potter Map unit will be populated with the following data:
	The slope will be 3 to 20 percent.  The slope range was verified using IFSAR slope generated maps.
	The MLRA will be 77E and the landform for this map unit will be draws and escarpments.
	All Potter soils will be classified as Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic, shallow Petronodic Ustic Haplocalcids.
	WEI will be 56 and the WEG will be 5. 
	All map units will be Not Prime Farmland.

Spatial Data Quality: 

A.  Spatial joins match across county boundaries but map unit names and slope ranges will need to be revised in future updates.  The joins are currently acceptable. 
B.  Howard/Mitchell polygon line joins should be corrected in future project or update mapping. This would be a simple task since the map units are similar, only line corrections would need to be completed.  Most of the other
    spatial joins are acceptable.

Map unit concept notes and issues:  

The Pullman series was established in Potter County, Texas in 1929.  The Pullman Official Series Description (OSD) is based on the type location in Deaf Smith County, Texas.  The aggregate data for the MLRA map unit for this project was developed using the type location pedon from Deaf Smith County, Texas (S99TX117002).  This pedon description is also the Taxonomic unit description for the Pullman series in MLRA 77C.  There are no major spatial issues in this project. The Pullman series is a benchmark soil.  Continued documentation in the future will help improve and enhance the range of characteristics, physical and chemical properties, and map unit composition for these soils.

Use and Management: 

Major land uses: Pullman soils are used extensively for cropland. A few small areas are used as improved pasture or rangeland.

Cropland: This soil is well suited to cropland. The most common crops grown on this soil are corn, wheat, grain sorghum, and cotton. Other crops include soybeans and forage sorghum. The main concerns in management are conserving soil moisture and controlling soil erosion. Fertilizer applications, reduced tillage, high-residue cover crops, and crop residue management can help reduce the soil temperature, conserve moisture, and improve or maintain soil tilth and productivity. Terraces, contour farming, grassed waterways, and diversion terraces, where needed, can help control runoff and water erosion. Improved varieties of bermudagrass and bluestems are the major pasture grasses grown on these soils. Fertilizer applications, weed control, brush management, proper stocking rates, and controlled grazing can help conserve soil moisture and improve or maintain productivity.

Rangeland: This soil is moderately suited to rangeland. Native plants are dominantly shortgrasses, which produce moderate amounts of forage. The main concerns in management are continuous overgrazing, fire suppression, invasion of woody species, and low order perennial grasses or annual forbs. Proper stocking rates, brush management, and controlled grazing can help improve or maintain productivity.

Urban Development: This soil is moderately suited to most urban uses. They are very limited as a site for small commercial buildings, dwellings without basements, local roads and streets, septic tank absorption fields, trench sanitary landfills, and use as daily cover for landfills. The high shrink-swell potential, low soil strength, restricted permeability, and high clay content of the soil are major limitations. The shrink-swell can cause cracking of building foundations, brick walls, road surfaces, sidewalks, and pipelines. Adding sand or other non-expansive material can minimize the structural damage caused by shrinking and swelling of the soils. Special treatment is necessary to increase the stability of road subgrades. Foundations generally require extra reinforcement. The slow permeability may cause failure of septic tank absorption systems, especially during prolonged wet periods. This limitation can be overcome by properly designing the absorption field and by increasing the size of the absorption area. Pipelines, storage tanks, and other underground structures made of uncoated steel should be protected from the high corrosion potential of these soils. This can be overcome by providing cathodic protection or by using galvanized steel.

Recreational Development: This soil is well suited to most recreational uses.

Wildlife Habitat: This soil has good potential for use as wildlife habitat. The slow soil percolation, high clay content, and moderately arid conditions which can limit plant growth necessary for good habitat are minor limitations.

Analysis of Published Manuscript Map Unit Descriptions and NASIS Data

Composition:
Pullman soils are 85 to 95 percent of the map unit based on analysis of the old manuscripts and NASIS data.

Minor Components:
Estacado, Lofton, and Olton soils are the inclusions named in old manuscripts. The Estacado, Olton, and Pantex are soils included in the new MLRA data map unit.

Landscape, Landform and Positions for Components:
Nearly level plains is the landform described in the old manuscripts. Plains occurring on Plateaus is the landform and landscape described in NASIS for the MLRA map unit.

Major Land Uses:
The major land use for this map unit is cropland with a few acres still remaining in range.  There are areas of irrigated and non-irrigated crops.  Approximate percentages of land use are 85 percent cropland, 13 percent rangeland, and 2 percent or less as urban or other land use.

Additional items:
During the evaluation of this map unit some field work was conducted to better evaluate the Pullman soil.  An adequate amount of transects and descriptions were collected along with soil samples for local lab work.  Also many field observations and notes were collected during this time.  The data collected is adequate for the map unit but provides some generalizations of the Pullman series and map unit.  The Pullman series is a benchmark soil.
Full lab characterization data for the Pullman series has been sampled and analyzed by KSSL and University labs over the years.  More local lab data will be collected for these soils to complement the KSSL data. More detailed soil descriptions for the range of characteristics in the series and transects for map unit composition is will also continue.  This information should be collected in a MLRA update of 77C in the future.

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
There are only a few minor differences between the existing Pullman map units and the MLRA map unit. 
The permeability in the upper 25 cm in a couple of the Pullman map units will be changed from moderately slow to slow.  
The surface texture for three counties will be changed from silty clay loam to clay loam.
The K factor will change from .28 to .37 for most counties.
The elevations, range productivity, and other soil properties may vary slightly from the new MLRA map unit but are insignificant and will not change interpretations for any county on this map unit.
The WEI/WEG, T-Factor, or capability class will not change for any map unit.
All map units are Prime Farmland.

Pedon Data in NASIS:
1.	There are 266 Pullman pedons in NASIS.
2.	There are 174 Pullman notes in NASIS
3.	There are 18 transects for Pullman in NASIS.
4.	None of the pedons except for typical pedons are linked to the components in NASIS.
5.	The pedons are distributed throughout the MLRA area.
6.	There is an adequate amount of documentation and lab data for the Pullman series and for the composition of this map unit.

Other Attribute Issues:
Pullman is an MLRA 77C series but currently is mapped in a few small areas of MLRA 77E in a few survey areas.  The OSD lies in the western extent of MLRA 77C.  The Pantex series has been documented in both Armstrong and Oldham County.  Future updates will solve join conflicts with the Pantex and Pullman map units.

Evaluation of Map Unit Interpretations

Interpretation Join Issues:
Join issues for soil interpretations are very limited and minor.  Most interpretations are almost identical for the older map units and the new MLRA map unit.  Differences include minor interpretations changes on soil strength, shrink-swell class, and frost action.  These changes will not be conflicting across county boundaries.

Evaluation of the Spatial Data

Spatial Join Issues:
Most spatial join issues are between the Pantex and Pullman map unit.  Some survey areas have been updated to the Pantex series.  Other join conflicts are clay loam vs. silty clay loam.  When surveys have been updated to the Pantex map unit all of these join issues will be resolved.

Spatial Data Quality: 
Spatial data quality is very good for this map unit in MLRA 77C surveys.  Soil lines fit landforms adequately and the quality of the line work is acceptable.

Slope Analysis: 
Slope analysis was not needed for this map unit.

Future Project Needs:
In MLRA 77C future project needs will include more evaluations of line quality and map accuracy of the Pullman clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes map unit.  For areas in MLRA 77C that have not been updated the Pullman map unit will need to be reviewed in the field.  There are areas where the Pantex and Olton series will most likely need to be separated from the Pullman map unit.  Only a very modest amount of KSSL characterization data will be needed in the future for Pullman.  A small amount of local lab data is also needed for these soils to help characterize the series. A few more soils descriptions for the range of characteristics and transects for map unit composition is also recommended.

Map unit concept notes and issues:
The Pullman series was established in Potter County, Texas in 1929.  The Pullman Official Series Description (OSD) is based on the type location in Deaf Smith County, Texas.  The aggregate data for the MLRA map unit for this project was developed using the type location pedon from Deaf Smith County, Texas (S99TX117002).  This pedon description is also the Taxonomic unit description for the Pullman series in MLRA 77C.  There are no major spatial issues in this project. The Pullman series is a benchmark soil.  Continued documentation in the future will help improve and enhance the range of characteristics, physical and chemical properties, and map unit composition for these soils.

Use and Management: 

Major land uses: Pullman soils are used extensively for cropland. A few small areas are used as improved pasture or rangeland.

Cropland: This soil is well suited to cropland. The most common crops grown on this soil are corn, wheat, grain sorghum, and cotton. Other crops include soybeans and forage sorghum. The main concerns in management are conserving soil moisture and controlling soil erosion. Fertilizer applications, reduced tillage, high-residue cover crops, and crop residue management can help reduce the soil temperature, conserve moisture, and improve or maintain soil tilth and productivity. Terraces, contour farming, grassed waterways, and diversion terraces, where needed, can help control runoff and water erosion. Improved varieties of bermudagrass and bluestems are the major pasture grasses grown on these soils. Fertilizer applications, weed control, brush management, proper stocking rates, and controlled grazing can help conserve soil moisture and improve or maintain productivity.

Rangeland: This soil is moderately suited to rangeland. Native plants are dominantly shortgrasses, which produce moderate amounts of forage. The main concerns in management are continuous overgrazing, fire suppression, invasion of woody species, and low order perennial grasses or annual forbs. Proper stocking rates, brush management, and controlled grazing can help improve or maintain productivity.

Urban Development: This soil is moderately suited to most urban uses. They are very limited as a site for small commercial buildings, dwellings without basements, local roads and streets, septic tank absorption fields, trench sanitary landfills, and use as daily cover for landfills. The high shrink-swell potential, low soil strength, restricted permeability, and high clay content of the soil are major limitations. The shrink-swell can cause cracking of building foundations, brick walls, road surfaces, sidewalks, and pipelines. Adding sand or other non-expansive material can minimize the structural damage caused by shrinking and swelling of the soils. Special treatment is necessary to increase the stability of road subgrades. Foundations generally require extra reinforcement. The slow permeability may cause failure of septic tank absorption systems, especially during prolonged wet periods. This limitation can be overcome by properly designing the absorption field and by increasing the size of the absorption area. Pipelines, storage tanks, and other underground structures made of uncoated steel should be protected from the high corrosion potential of these soils. This can be overcome by providing cathodic protection or by using galvanized steel.

Recreational Development: This soil is well suited to most recreational uses.

Wildlife Habitat: This soil has good potential for use as wildlife habitat. The slow soil percolation, high clay content, and moderately arid conditions which can limit plant growth necessary for good habitat are minor limitations.

Analysis of Published Manuscript Map Unit Descriptions and NASIS Data

Composition:
Pullman soils are 85 to 95 percent of the map unit based on analysis of the old manuscripts and NASIS data.

Minor Components:
Estacado, Lofton, and Olton soils are the inclusions named in old manuscripts. The Olton, Estacado, and Pep are soils included in the new MLRA data map unit.

Landscape, Landform and Positions for Components:
The landform for according to the OSD sight is nearly level, to gently sloping plains, or playa slopes.
The landscape according to NASIS is plateaus, and the landform is plains. These soils occur near or around playa slopes.
  
Major Land Uses:
The major land use for this map unit is cropland with a few acres still remaining in range.  There are areas of irrigated and non-irrigated crops.  Approximate percentages of land use are 75 percent cropland, 23 percent rangeland, and 2 percent or less as urban or other land use.

Additional items:
During the evaluation of this map unit some field work was conducted to better evaluate the Pullman soil.  An adequate amount of transects and descriptions were collected along with soil samples for local lab work.  Also many field observations and notes were collected during this time.  The data collected is adequate for the map unit but provides some generalizations of the Pullman series and map unit.  The Pullman series is a benchmark soil.
Full lab characterization data for the Pullman series has been sampled and analyzed by KSSL and University labs over the years.  More local lab data will be collected for these soils to complement the KSSL data. More detailed soil descriptions for the range of characteristics in the series and transects for map unit composition is will also continue.  This information should be collected in a MLRA update of 77C in the future.

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
Some differences between the map units and the MLRA map unit are within:
The MLRA location for Dickens County, Texas is in both 77C and 77B, while the rest of the map units occur in 77C.
First mineral horizon names (H1) should be changed to match the MLRA map unit (Ap).
The permeability for some of the map units are slow and moderately slow. The MLRA map unit along with a couple other map units is very slow.
The runoff class for most of the map units is either blank or high, but the MLRA map unit is medium.

Other Attribute Issues:
Pullman is an MLRA 77C series but currently is mapped in a few small areas of MLRA 77E in a few survey areas.  The OSD lies in the western extent of MLRA 77C.
Evaluation of Map Unit Interpretations

Evaluation of Map Unit Interpretations

Interpretation Join Issues:
Join issues for soil interpretations are very limited and minor.  Most interpretations are almost identical for the older map units and the new MLRA map unit.  Differences include minor interpretations changes on soil strength, shrink-swell class, and frost action.  These changes will not be conflicting across county boundaries.

Evaluation of the Spatial Data

Spatial Join Issues:
There are no major spatial join issues with this map unit.

Spatial Data Quality: 
Spatial data quality is very good for this map unit in MLRA 77C surveys.  Soil lines fit landforms adequately and the quality of the line work is acceptable.
The map unit location in Dickens County, Texas is in both 77C and 78B, while the rest of the map units occur in 77C.  There are some map units outside of the MLRA region, but the majority of the map units are within the MLRA region.

Slope Analysis:
No slope analysis was conducted. All project map units have the same slope.

Future Project Needs:
In MLRA 77C future project needs will include more evaluations of line quality and map accuracy of the Pullman clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes map unit.  For areas in MLRA 77C that have not been updated the Pullman map unit will need to be reviewed in the field.  Only a very modest amount of KSSL characterization data will be needed in the future for Pullman.   A small amount of local lab data is also needed for these soils to help characterize the series. A few more soils descriptions for the range of characteristics and transects for map unit composition is also recommended.

They are very limited as a site for small commercial buildings, dwellings without basements, local roads and streets, septic tank absorption fields, trench sanitary landfills, and use as daily cover for landfills. The high shrink-swell potential, low soil strength, restricted permeability, and high clay content of the soil are major limitations. The shrink-swell can cause cracking of building foundations, brick walls, road surfaces, sidewalks, and pipelines. Adding sand or other non-expansive material can minimize the structural damage caused by shrinking and swelling of the soils. Special treatment is necessary to increase the stability of road subgrades. Foundations generally require extra reinforcement. The slow permeability may cause failure of septic tank absorption systems, especially during prolonged wet periods. This limitation can be overcome by properly designing the absorption field and by increasing the size of the absorption area. Pipelines, storage tanks, and other underground structures made of uncoated steel should be protected from the high corrosion potential of these soils. This can be overcome by providing cathodic protection or by using galvanized steel."|"363777"|"1851127"

Map unit composition determined by the published manuscripts. Component percentages were determined by analysis of the published manuscripts and expert knowledge of individuals that have worked in the area. Additional transect data will be required.

Classification:
Lofton classification: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Vertic Argiustolls
The Lofton series was established in 1940 in Harding County, NM.

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations:
The Lofton clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slope map unit is on nearly level playa steps or shallow depressions on the Southern High Plains. These soils are occasionally ponded for very brief periods during heavy rainfall events. Lofton soils are high shrink-swell and have a mollic epipedon, argillic horizon, and a calcic horizon between 100 and 150 cm. The average annual temperature for this map unit ranges from 57 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit. The average annual precipitation for this map unit ranges from 17 to 21 inches. 

Typically, the surface layer is dark gray clay loam to 23 cm. The subsoil below this layer is dark grayish brown clay to 97 cm. The next layer is strongly effervescent clay with about 3 percent calcium carbonate by volume as threads and coatings on ped surfaces and pores. Below this layer to 203 cm is violently effervescent grayish brown clay with about 25 percent calcium carbonate by volume as masses and nodules.

The Lofton component makes up 85 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. This component is on depressions on plateaus, playa steps on plateaus. The parent material consists of clayey lacustrine deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is moderately well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is very low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches is high.  Shrink-swell potential is high.  The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 8 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface.  This soil is not flooded. It is rarely ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 3 percent. 


Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
Lofton clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes is mapped over multiple geologies and MLRA boundaries.  The OSD lies in the northern range of the series extent in MLRA 77C.  The data populated in NASIS for the Lofton map units is almost identical. The ESDs are identical and range productivity is almost identical as well.  Series taxonomic classification, parent material, and landforms are identical.  The climatic data and elevations are insignificant between map units.  The chemical and physical data varies only slightly between components.  One significant change that will be made on the SDJR map unit will be on water Features.  The map unit will have a ponding frequency of rare where the old map units did not.
Because a few of the Lofton map units cross MLRA boundaries future projects should be included to update these areas that are mapped Lofton and perhaps establish a new series for these areas as well.

Use and Management:

Major land uses: These soils are used extensively for cropland. A few areas are used as improved pasture or rangeland.

Cropland: This soil is well suited to cropland. The most common crops grown are wheat, grain sorghum, corn, and cotton. Other crops include alfalfa, forage sorghum, and soybeans. The main concerns in management are conserving soil moisture and controlling soil erosion. Fertilizer applications, reduced tillage, high-residue cover crops, and crop residue management can help reduce the soil temperature, conserve moisture, and improve or maintain soil tilth and productivity. Terraces, contour farming, grassed waterways, and diversion terraces, where needed, can help control runoff and water erosion. Improved varieties of bermudagrass and bluestems are the major pasture grasses grown on these soils. Fertilizer applications, weed control, brush management, proper stocking rates, and controlled grazing can help conserve soil moisture and improve or maintain productivity.

Rangeland: This soil is moderately suited to rangeland. Native plants are dominantly shortgrasses, which produce moderate amounts of forage. The main concerns in management are continuous overgrazing, fire suppression, invasion of woody species, and low order perennial grasses or annual forbs. Proper stocking rates, brush management, and controlled grazing can help improve or maintain productivity.

Urban Development: This soil is moderately suited to most urban uses. They are very limited as a site for septic tank absorption fields and for local roads and streets. The low soil strength and restricted permeability are major limitations. Because of low soil strenth, special treatment is necessary to increase the stability of road sub-grades. The moderately slow permeability may cause failure of septic tank absorption systems, especially during prolonged wet periods. This limitation can be overcome by properly designing the absorption field and by increasing the size of the absorption area. The shrink-swell potential is somewhat limiting for dwellings or small commercial buildings. The shrink-swell can cause cracking of building foundations, brick walls, road surfaces, sidewalks, and pipelines. Adding sand or other non-expansive material can minimize the structural damage caused by shrinking and swelling of the soils.
Recreational Development: This soil is well suited to recreational uses.
Wildlife Habitat: This soil has good potential for use as wildlife habitat. The moderately arid conditions, which can limit plant growth necessary for good habitat is a minor limitation.

Analysis of published Manuscript Map Unit Descriptions and NASIS Data Composition:
Olton soils are between 85 to 100 percent of the map unit based on the old manuscript and NASIS data.

Minor components:
Acuff, Pullman, and Estacado soils are the inclusions named in old manuscripts. The Acuff, Pullman, and Estacado soils are included in the new MLRA data map unit.

Landscape, Landform, and Positions for Components:
The landscape position described in the old manuscripts for Olton soils are soils on very gently sloping plains and upper side slopes of playas and draws.   The landform in NASIS is plain or playa slope and the landscape is plateaus. 

Major Land Uses:
 The major land use for this map unit is cropland with a few acres still remaining in range.  There are areas of irrigated and non-irrigated crops.  Approximate percentages of land use are 85 percent cropland, 13 percent rangeland, and 2 percent or less as urban or other land use.

Additional items:
During the evaluation of this map unit some field work was conducted to better evaluate the Olton soil.  An adequate amount of transects and descriptions were collected along with soil samples for local lab work.  Also many field observations and notes were collected during this time.  The data collected is adequate for the map unit but provides some generalizations of the Olton series and map unit.  The Olton series is a benchmark soil.
Full lab characterization data for the Olton series has been sampled and analyzed by KSSL and University labs over the years.  More local lab data will be collected for these soils to complement the KSSL data. More detailed soil descriptions for the range of characteristics in the series and transects for map unit composition is will also continue.  This information should be collected in a MLRA update of 77C in the future.

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
There are only a few minor differences between the existing Pullman map units and the MLRA map unit. 
	There are minor differences in some counties for the range of MAP compared to the MLRA map unit.
	Runoff class will be low for the MLRA map unit.
	The calculated Kw/Kf will be 0.24 for the MLRA map unit.  Some older map units were 0.32 or 0.37. 
	All areas are Prime Farmland except Curry/SW Quay which is Prime Farmland if irrigated.

Spatial Data Quality:
Spatial data quality is very good for this map unit in MLRA 77C surveys.  Soil lines fit landforms adequately and the quality of the line work is acceptable.

Slope Analysis:
No slope analysis was conducted. All project map units have the same slope breaks.

Future Project Needs:
In MLRA 77C future project needs will include more evaluations of line quality and map accuracy of the Olton clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes map unit.  Lab characterization data for the series should be sampled in a backhoe pit and data sent to the Lincoln lab for analysis.  Local lab data is also needed for these soils to help characterize the series. Also more soils descriptions for the range of characteristics and transects for map unit composition is recommended. This information should be collected in a MLRA update of 77C in the future.

Map unit concept notes and issues:
The Olton series was established in Lamb County, Texas in 1960.  The Olton Official Series Description (OSD) is based on the type location in Randall County, Texas.  The aggregate data for the MLRA map unit for this project was developed using the type location pedon from Randall County, Texas (S90TX381001).  This pedon description is also the Taxonomic unit description for the Olton series in MLRA 77C.  There are no major spatial issues in this project. The Olton series is a benchmark soil.  Continued documentation in the future will help improve and enhance the range of characteristics, physical and chemical properties, and map unit composition for these soils.

Use and Management:

Major land uses: These soils are used mainly as rangeland and wildlife habitat. A few areas are used as improved pasture or cropland.

Cropland: This soil is well suited to cropland. The most common crops grown are wheat, grain sorghum, corn, and cotton. Other crops include alfalfa, forage sorghum, and soybeans. The main concerns in management are conserving soil moisture and controlling soil erosion. Fertilizer applications, reduced tillage, high-residue cover crops, and crop residue management can help reduce the soil temperature, conserve moisture, and improve or maintain soil tilth and productivity. Terraces, contour farming, grassed waterways, and diversion terraces, where needed, can help control runoff and water erosion. Improved varieties of bermudagrass and bluestems are the major pasture grasses grown on these soils. Fertilizer applications, weed control, brush management, proper stocking rates, and controlled grazing can help conserve soil moisture and improve or maintain productivity.

Rangeland: This soil is moderately suited to rangeland. Native plants are dominantly shortgrasses, which produce moderate amounts of forage. The main concerns in management are continuous overgrazing, fire suppression, invasion of woody species, and low order perennial grasses or annual forbs. Proper stocking rates, brush management, and controlled grazing can help improve or maintain productivity.

Urban Development: This soil is moderately suited to most urban uses. They are very limited as a site for septic tank absorption fields and for local roads and streets. The low soil strength and restricted permeability are major limitations. Because of low soil strength, special treatment is necessary to increase the stability of road sub-grades. The moderately slow permeability may cause failure of septic tank absorption systems, especially during prolonged wet periods. This limitation can be overcome by properly designing the absorption field and by increasing the size of the absorption area. The shrink-swell potential is somewhat limiting for dwellings or small commercial buildings. The shrink-swell can cause cracking of building foundations, brick walls, road surfaces, sidewalks, and pipelines. Adding sand or other non-expansive material can minimize the structural damage caused by shrinking and swelling of the soils.

Recreational Development: This soil is well suited to recreational uses.

Wildlife Habitat: This soil has good potential for use as wildlife habitat. The moderately arid conditions, which can limit plant growth necessary for good habitat is a minor limitation.

Analysis of published Manuscript Map Unit Descriptions and NASIS Data Composition:
Olton soils are between 85 to 100 percent of the map unit based on the old manuscript and NASIS data.

Minor components:
Acuff, Pullman, and Estacado soils are the inclusions named in old manuscripts. The Acuff, Pullman, and Estacado soils are included in the new MLRA data map unit.

Landscape, Landform, and Positions for Components:
The landscape position described in the old manuscripts for Olton soils are soils on very gently sloping plains and upper side slopes of playas and draws.   The landform in NASIS is plain or playa slope and the landscape is plateaus. 

Major Land Uses:
 The major land use for this map unit is cropland with a few acres still remaining in range.  There are areas of irrigated and non-irrigated crops.  Approximate percentages of land use are 85 percent cropland, 13 percent rangeland, and 2 percent or less as urban or other land use.

Additional items:
During the evaluation of this map unit some field work was conducted to better evaluate the Olton soil.  An adequate amount of transects and descriptions were collected along with soil samples for local lab work.  Also many field observations and notes were collected during this time.  The data collected is adequate for the map unit but provides some generalizations of the Olton series and map unit.  The Olton series is a benchmark soil.
Full lab characterization data for the Olton series has been sampled and analyzed by KSSL and University labs over the years.  More local lab data will be collected for these soils to complement the KSSL data. More detailed soil descriptions for the range of characteristics in the series and transects for map unit composition is will also continue.  This information should be collected in a MLRA update of 77C in the future.

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
There are only a few minor differences between the existing Olton map units and the MLRA map unit. 

Runoff class will be medium for the MLRA map unit.
The calculated Kw/Kf will be 0.24 for the MLRA map unit.  Some older map units were 0.32. 
All areas are Prime Farmland.

Typically, the surface layer is dark gray clay about 30 cm thick. The subsoil is very dark gray clay about 64 cm thick with a few masses of iron-manganese. Below this layer to 203 cm is a very dark grayish brown clay with a few iron-manganese nodules. 
The Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches is high.  Shrink-swell potential is very high. This soil is not flooded. It is occasionally ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 0 inches during May, June, July, August, September, October, and November. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 3 percent. This component is in the R077CY027TX Playa 16-21"" Pz ecological site. The natural plant community of a playa is highly variable and dependent on the hydrology of the playa basin being considered. The dominance of hydrophytic plants or upland plants depends on the degree, frequency, and time of inundation. Vegetation varies according to the amount of water available during the growing season. On average years, this site is usually inundated and saturated for longer periods. The natural plant community is dominantly a mixture of hydrophytic forbs, grasses, and grasslike plants. The most prevalent species on the site is creeping spikerush, pennsylvania smartweed, saltmarsh aster, bur ragweed, curly dock, bushy knotweed, and sedges. Varying amounts of grasses are present and include knotgrass, barnyard grass, and western wheatgrass. In areas of standing water, southern cattail, softstem bulrush, and spiked arrowhead may be present. Occasionally there will be a few willows and cottonwoods present around the periphery of the playa.  Non-irrigated land capability classification is 6w.  The major land uses for these soils is wildlife and some pasture, they are not generally farmed because of ponding.  This soil meets hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 2 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. The average annual temperature for this map unit ranges from 57 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit. The average annual precipitation for this map unit ranges from 17 to 21 inches. Minor components identified in this map unit are the McLean soils. McLean soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and are moist for shorter duration than Randall soils.
Map unit composition determined by the published manuscripts. Component percentages were determined by analysis of the published manuscripts and expert knowledge of individuals that have worked in the area. Additional transect data will be required.
The future needs for this and surrounding map units are to refine the differences between areas mapped Randall clay in an update mapping project for Counties in MLRA 77C.  An extensive amount of the Randall clay map units should be correlated to one or more of the following series: McLean, Sparenberg, Ranco, or Chapel. These areas cannot be corrected by an SDJR Project without extensive field work.

These soils formed in clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. McLean soils are occasionally ponded for brief periods. The average annual precipitation for this map unit ranges from 17 to 21 inches. The average annual temperature for this map unit ranges from 57 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit.
Typically, the surface layer is dark gray clay with a few iron-manganese concretions that is about 18 cm thick. The subsoil is dark gray clay with common prominent slickensides, few fine iron-manganese concretions and few fine calcium carbonate nodules to 150 cm. Below this layer to 203 cm is slightly to strongly effervescent grayish brown clay with common prominent slickensides, few fine masses of iron accumulation in pore linings, and about 4 percent calcium carbonate by volume in the form of masses and nodules.
The McLean component makes up 80 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. This component is on circular gilgai on playa floors on plateaus. The parent material consists of clayey lacustrine deposits. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches is high.  Shrink-swell potential is very high. This soil is not flooded. It is occasionally ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent. This component is in the R077CY027TX Playa 16-21"" Pz ecological site. Native vegetation varies according to amount of water available. It includes western wheatgrass, buffalograss, blue grama, vine mesquite, texas blueweed, kochia, western ragweed, cocklebur, sunflower, and mares-tail. Bur ragweed, sedges, spike rushes, bushy knotweed, frog-fruit, and saltmarsh aster may occur in wetter areas. Non-irrigated land capability classification is 4w. Irrigated land capability classification is 4w. While not extensively used for cropland this soil is moderately suited. The most common crops grown on this soil are grain sorghum, wheat, cotton, and forage sorghum. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 2 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. 
Minor components identified in this map unit are the Randall and Lockney soils. The Randall soils are on similar landscape positions and are frequently ponded. The Lockney soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and are rarely ponded. Also included in mapping are small areas of calcareous soils and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 
Map unit composition determined by the published manuscripts. Component percentages were determined by analysis of the published manuscripts and expert knowledge of individuals that have worked in the area. Additional transect data will be required.
The future needs for this and surrounding map units are to refine the differences between areas mapped Randall and Lockney soils in an update mapping project for Counties in MLRA 77C.

Use and Management: 

Major land uses: These soils are used primarily as rangeland and habitat for wildlife. They are not used extensively as cropland or improved pasture.

Cropland: While not extensively used for cropland this soil is moderately suited. The most common crops grown on this soil are grain sorghum, wheat, cotton, and forage sorghum. The available water holding capacity and high carbonate content of the soil are limitations. The hazard of wind erosion is severe. The main concerns in management are conserving soil moisture and controlling soil erosion. Fertilizer applications, reduced tillage, high-residue cover crops, and crop residue management can help reduce the soil temperature, conserve moisture, and improve or maintain soil tilth and productivity. Terraces, contour farming, grassed waterways, and diversion terraces, where needed, can help control runoff and water erosion. Improved varieties of Bermuda grass and bluestems are the major pasture grasses grown on these soils. Fertilizer applications, weed control, brush management, proper stocking rates, and controlled grazing can help conserve soil moisture and improve or maintain productivity.

Rangeland: This soil is moderately suited to rangeland. Native plants yield moderate amounts of forage. The high carbonate content and available water holding capacity of the soil are limitations. The hazard of wind erosion is severe. The main concerns in management are continuous overgrazing, fire suppression, invasion of woody species, and low order perennial grasses or annual forbs. Proper stocking rates, brush management, and controlled grazing can help improve or maintain productivity.

Urban Development: This soil is moderately suited to most urban uses. They are very limited for use as daily cover for landfills, lawns and landscaping, road-fill material, or the construction of roads and streets. The high carbonate content and low soil strength are major limitations. Because of low soil strength, special treatment is necessary to increase the stability of road sub-grades. Pipelines, storage tanks, and other underground structures made of uncoated steel should be protected from the high corrosion potential of these soils. This can be overcome by providing cathodic protection or by using galvanized steel.

Recreational Development: This soil is moderately suited to most recreational uses. They are very limited as a site for golf fairways. The available water holding capacity and high carbonate content of the soil is a major limitation.

Wildlife Habitat: This soil has fair potential for use as wildlife habitat. The moderately arid conditions, which can limit plant growth necessary for good habitat is a minor limitation. Wind erosion is a potential hazard for grain and seed crops used for food and cover.

Analysis of published Manuscript Map Unit Descriptions and NASIS Data 

Composition:
Pep soils are between 75 to 95 percent of the map unit based on the NASIS data. In the old manuscript the Pep soils are between 70 to 90 percent of the map unit.

Minor components:
Included with the Pep map unit are Berda, Estacado, Plemons, Potter, and Veal soils as described in the old manuscripts. 
There are 20 percent of minor components in the Pep map unit as described in NASIS and include Mansker, Bovina, and Estacado soils.

Landscape, Landform, and Positions for Components:
The landform for the Pep map unit is playa slopes and draws and the landscape is plateaus as described in NASIS.  In the old manuscripts these soils are on gently sloping side slopes of draws and playa slopes. Areas range from a few acres to 200 acres.  

Major Land Uses:
These soils are primarily used for livestock grazing. Where cultivated, the principal crops are wheat and forage sorghum. The main concerns in management are controlling soil blowing and erosion and conserving moisture.  The ecological site is Limy Upland (R077CY028TX).

Additional items:
During the evaluation of this map unit some field work was conducted to better evaluate the Pep soil.  A small amount of field observations and notes were collected during this time.  The data collected is adequate for the map unit but provides some generalizations of the Pep series and map unit.
Full lab characterization data for the Pep series should be sampled in a backhoe pit and data sent to the Lincoln lab for analysis in the future.  More local lab data is also needed for these soils to complement the KSSL data. More detailed soil descriptions for the range of characteristics in the series and transects for map unit composition is recommended. This information should be collected in a MLRA update of 77C in the future.

Describe Differences Between MLRA Map Unit and Map Units Being Harmonized:
	The RV elevation for the MLRA map unit is slightly higher than some of the older map units.
	The FFD are slightly higher for the MLRA map unit.
	The AWC is slightly lower for the MLRA map unit.
	The calculated T factor will be a 3 for the MLRA map unit, the older map units were a 5.
	The calculated WEI/WEG will be an 86/4L.  The older map units were a 48/6.
	This soil is Not Prime Farmland.

There are general join issues between Oldham County, Deaf Smith, Randall, Castro, Parmer, Curry, Oldham, Potter, Swisher, Armstrong, Roberts, Gray, Donley, and Briscoe Counties.

Spatial Data Quality:
The line quality is good and matches the digital photography quite well.

Slope Analysis:
No slope analysis was conducted. All project map units have the same slope breaks.

Future Project Needs: 
In MLRA 77C future project needs will include more evaluations of line quality and map accuracy of the Pep clay loam, 3 to 5 percent slopes map unit.  Lab characterization data for the series should be sampled in a backhoe pit and data sent to the Lincoln lab for analysis.  Local lab data is also needed for these soils to help characterize the series. Also more soils descriptions for the range of characteristics and transects for map unit composition is recommended. This information should be collected in a MLRA update of 77C in the future.

02/12/2013 00:00:00|"Map unit description"|"map unit concept"||"The Sparenberg clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, occasionally ponded map unit characterizes very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that occur on playa floors. These soils formed in clayey lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age. Typically, the surface layer is dark grayish brown clay which is about 4 inches thick.  The subsoil begins with a dark gray clay layer which is about 43 inches thick.  Below this layer to a depth of 61 inches is a gray clay layer.  Below this layer to a depth of 80 inches is grayish brown clay with about 5 percent visible calcium carbonate.   The depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class somewhat poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is very slow.  Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is high.  Shrink-swell potential is very high. This soil is not flooded and annual ponding is occasional. The minimum depth to a water table is greater than 6 feet. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent. This component is in the R077CY027TX Playa 16-21"" Pz ecological site.  The natural plant community is dominantly a mixture of Western wheatgrass, common spikerush, bur ragweed, Pennsylvania smartweed, vine mesquite, buffalograss, aster, knotgrass with lesser amounts of various perennial and annual grasses and forbs.  Non-irrigated land capability classification is 4w.  The major land uses for these soils is wildlife and some pasture.  The maximum calcium carbonate equivalent within a depth of 40 inches is 5 percent. There are no saline horizons, and there are no sodic horizons within this soil.  The average annual temperature for this map unit ranges from 58 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit.  The average annual precipitation for this map unit ranges from 15 to 20 inches.  Minor components indentified in this map unit are the Ranco, Chapel and Seagraves soils.  Ranco soils are ponded for longer periods and exhibit aquic conditions.  Chapel soils have a maximum calcium carbonate equivalent within a depth of 40 inches of 50 percent.  Seagraves soils have fine sandy loam surface textures with lighter surface colors and less organic matter.  Ranco, Chapel and Seagraves soils occur on similar landforms compared to the Sparenberg soils.
Map unit composition was determined by published manuscripts.  Map unit component percentages were determined by analysis of the published manuscripts, transects and the expert knowledge of the individuals who have worked within the area.

Overcoming many of these limitations is difficult and costly. Under certain conditions, trench sidewalls can become highly unstable in this soil. Trenches that have been excavated to more than a depth of 5 feet should be shored or the sidewall should be graded to an angle that ensures safe working conditions. Pipelines, storage tanks, and other underground structures made of uncoated steel should be protected from the moderate corrosion potential of these soils.

Pertinent soil properties and qualities, and interpretations: 
The Zita clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy eolian sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.

Typically, the surface layer is brown, clay loam about18cm thick.  The subsoil to about 96cm of brown to grayish, clay to silty clay loam that is strongly effervescent.  Below this layer is a layer of brown to grayish white clay to silty clay loam with visible calcium carbonates that are violently effervescent with few nodules to 203cm.

The Zita component makes up 85 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. This component is on plains on plateaus. The parent material consists of loamy eolian deposits over calcareous loamy lacustrine deposits. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent. This component is in the R077CY022TX Deep Hardland 16-21"" Pz ecological site. Non-irrigated land capability classification is 3e. Irrigated land capability classification is 2e. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 55 percent. There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface.
         
Other Expert Knowledge Gained Through SDJR:
Zita clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes is mapped on a single geology and one MLRA boundary.  The OSD likes in the central range of the series extent in MLRA 77C.  The series has been mapped with one slope phase and 1 surface texture phase as well.  The data populated in NASIS for the Zita map unit are almost identical.  The ESDs are identical and the range productivity is very close among the map units.  The series taxonomic classification is current and correct for the representative DMU but some of the historical map units are missing the activity class.  The parent materials are largely the same for all map units; some of the historical units do not include the name or age of the geologic formation.  The landforms are largely correct, all map units mention the landform as plains but not all include plays slopes as the representative DMU does. There are largely insignificant differences among the climatic data and elevations.  The USLE Factors are nearly identical among all map units and there are only insignificant differences among the chemical and physical properties and the water features are identical.

Spatial Data Quality:  No spatial data errors identified.
